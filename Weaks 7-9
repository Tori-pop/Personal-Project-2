I watched a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=govmXpDGLpo to understand tags in github.
  git tag = listing tags
  git tag -a v1.4 = tagging
  git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4" = documented tagging
  $ git push origin v1.4 = pushing to remote
  git checkout v1.4 = checking out tag
  $ git tag -d v1 = deleting tag
  git push --delete origin v1.4 = delete remote tag

I also learned about git flow and release branches, feture branches, hotfix branches, master brach and developement branch.
I how know what continuous integration and continuous depleoment means but I think I'll look more into it and its features later.
I also watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRlGDDprdOQ to firgure out the difference between rebase and merge,
but now I know that rebase isn't even viable in public repositories so kinda wast of 20 minuets

I relized maybe I didn't undertstand merging as much as I thought I did, so I watrched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyAAIHHClqI
and it was super indepth but now I just have more questions, like what really are servers and way more things he mentioned
Things I did learn are:
  fast forward merge
  three way merge
  merge commit
  merge conflicts - and how to fix it
  git graph
  detatched head state
  git stash
