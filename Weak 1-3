I've installed both github anf git
I stared a couple projects and I am now watching a few really interesting repositories.

Command in git that I've memorized 
     $ git status - Lists all new or modified files to be committed
     $ git diff - Shows file differences not yet staged
     $ git add [file] - Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning
     $ git diff --staged - Shows file differences between staging and the last file version
     $ git reset [file] - Unstages the file, but preserve its contents
     $ git commit -m "[descriptive message]" - Records file snapshots permanently in version history
     $ git config --global user.name "[name]" - Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions
     $ git config --global user.email "[email address]" - Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions
     $ git config --global color.ui auto - Enables helpful colorization of command line output
     $ git branch - Lists all local branches in the current repository
     $ git branch [branch-name] - Creates a new branch
     $ git checkout [branch-name] - Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory
     $ git merge [branch] - Combines the specified branch’s history into the current branch
     $ git branch -d [branch-name] - Deletes the specified branch
     $ git log - Lists version history for the current branch
     $ git log --follow [file] - Lists version history for a file, including renames
     $ git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch] - Shows content differences between two branches
     $ git show [commit] - Outputs metadata and content changes of the specified commit
     $ git fetch [bookmark] - Downloads all history from the repository bookmark
     $ git merge [bookmark]/[branch] - Combines bookmark’s branch into current local branch
     $ git push [alias] [branch] - Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub
     $ git pull - Downloads bookmark history and incorporates changes
     
I figured out how to use "Atom" with git as if I were a real programmer
I also have been usaling push and pull
