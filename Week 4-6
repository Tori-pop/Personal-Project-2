What I learned for week 4 through 6

THis is a list of things that I learned in all the videos I watched from week 4-6.
    Remote vs local repositories
#    
#  these lines are being typed in a new branch
#  I will create a pull request
#  Then merge it with the master branch

I've gone tyhrough and studied https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners

    Fork
    The last important network indicator of a project is the number of forks.
    This is key to how GitHub works, as a fork is the base of a Pull Request (PR), a change proposal. Starting from your repository,
    a person forks it, makes some changes, then creates a PR to ask you to merge those changes.
    Sometimes the person that forks never asks you to merge anything, just because they liked your code and decided to 
    add something on top of it, or they fixed some bug they were experiencing.
    A fork clones the files of a GitHub project, but not any of the stars or issues of the original project.

    Project management
    Along with issues, which are the place where developers get feedback from users, the GitHub interface offers other features 
    aimed at helping project management.
    One of those is Projects. It’s very new in the ecosystem and very rarely used, but it’s a kanban board that 
    helps organizing issues and work that needs to be done.
    The Wiki is intended to be used as a documentation for users. One of the most impressive usage of the Wiki I
    saw up to now is the Go Programming Language GitHub Wiki.
    Another popular project management aid is milestones. Part of the issues page, you can assign issues to specific 
    milestones, which could be release targets.
    Speaking of releases, GitHub enhances the Git tag functionality by introducing releases.
    A Git tag is a pointer to a specific commit, and if done consistently, helps you roll back to previous version of 
    your code without referencing specific commits.
    A GitHub release builds on top of Git tags and represents a complete release of your code, along with zip files, 
    release notes and binary assets that might represent a fully working version of your code end product.
    While a Git tag can be created programmatically (e.g. using the Command Line git program), creating a GitHub release 
    is a manual process that happens through the GitHub UI. You basically tell GitHub to create a new release and tell them which
    tag you want to apply that release to.

I looked at other coders projects and found the compare changes to see what has changed from one commit to another

I've read thgrough this gape, https://career-resource-center.udacity.com/linkedin-github-profiles/become-a-github-pro
and watched "becomg a github pro" 
-whitch took a lot of time

I spent an hours learning more about open source.
    they descussed their expearience with github and talk about the different ways to get involved and why its important.
    they went over ReadMes and licensing in github, and contributing
    - addalicence.com
    
I worked more with issues and now i understand how to assign people to issues, label them for the type of issue and set up milstones.

I watched the "GitHub and GitKraken - Merge Conflicts, File History, and File Blame"
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK4u5-Lwy5Q
    They chatted about a lot of stuff i didnt understand because it was ment for working developers but i did pick up on how to deal 
    with confics if more then one person changes the same code and how to use blame in git.
